    "answer": "Solar panel efficiency typically ranges from 15% to 20%, though newer models can reach efficiencies of up to 22%."
  },
  {
    "question": "How much energy can a solar panel system generate?",
    "answer": "The amount of energy generated by a solar panel system depends on the size of the system, the amount of sunlight, and the location. A typical 5 kW system can generate around 6,000 to 8,000 kWh of electricity per year."
  },
  {
    "question": "What factors affect solar panel efficiency?",
    "answer": "Factors that affect solar panel efficiency include the angle of the panels, the amount of direct sunlight, temperature, and the quality of the panels themselves."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I maintain my solar panels?",
    "answer": "Solar panels require minimal maintenance. Regular cleaning to remove dust and debris, checking for any visible damage, and ensuring proper functioning of the inverter are key maintenance tasks."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I use solar energy during the night?",
    "answer": "Solar energy systems produce electricity only when sunlight is available. However, excess energy can be stored in batteries or fed into the grid, allowing you to use it during the night."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the types of solar panels?",
    "answer": "The main types of solar panels are monocrystalline, polycrystalline, and thin-film. Monocrystalline panels are the most efficient, while thin-film panels are lightweight and flexible."
